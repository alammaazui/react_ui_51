## JSX
JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript files, making it easier to create and manage React elements.

## Props
React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
